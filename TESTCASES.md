Let's review the existing test cases and try to expand them.

In the first set of tests, we use the [search functionality](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Core_REST_API/Reference/Search/Search_content) to search for page content.

The easiest way to start is by referencing the documentation. The request has 4 parameters, and we need to verify their valid values, default values, mandatory nature, and their combinations.

An approximate list of checks could look like this:

1. Valid Request:
    * Description: Send a valid request with all required parameters.
    * Input: GET /core/v1/wikipedia/en/search/page?q=search+terms
    * Expected Output: 200 Success - Returns a pages array containing search results.

2. Valid Request with Limit:
    * Description: Send a valid request with all required parameters and a specified limit.
    * Input: GET /core/v1/wikipedia/en/search/page?q=search+terms&limit=10
    * Expected Output: 200 Success - Returns a pages array containing search results with a maximum of 10 results.
3. No Search Terms Provided:
    * Description: Send a request without providing search terms.
    * Input: GET /core/v1/wikipedia/en/search/page
    * Expected Output: 400 Bad Request - Query parameter not set. Add q parameter.
4. Invalid Limit Value:
    * Description: Send a request with an invalid limit value (outside the range of 1 to 100).
    * Input: GET /core/v1/wikipedia/en/search/page?q=search+terms&limit=200
    * Expected Output: 400 Bad Request - Invalid limit requested. Set limit parameter to between 1 and 100.
5. No Results Found:
    * Description: Send a request with valid search terms that yield no results.
    * Input: GET /core/v1/wikipedia/en/search/page?q=nonexistent+terms
    * Expected Output: 200 Success - No results found. Returns an empty pages array.
6. Unsupported Language:
    * Description: Send a request with an unsupported language parameter.
    * Input: GET /core/v1/commons/qwerty/search/page?q=search+terms
    * Expected Output: 400 Bad Request - Language parameter is prohibited for commons and other multilingual projects.
7. Missing Project Name:
    * Description: Send a request without providing the project name.
    * Input: GET /core/v1//en/search/page?q=search+terms
    * Expected Output: 400 Bad Request - Project name is required.
8. Missing Language Code:
    * Description: Send a request without providing the language code.
    * Input: GET /core/v1/wikipedia//search/page?q=search+terms
    * Expected Output: 400 Bad Request - Language code is required.

In the search section, there is also another endpoint for [searching by title](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/Core_REST_API/Reference/Search/Search_titles), and its test cases can be created in a similar way.

However, we should also pay attention to the search results. In the first test case, we are looking for the expected page among the results. However, there are several questions that need to be answered to ensure that the test case is reliable and reproducible:

* How is the position in the search results determined? Should we also check it?
* What happens if the desired page is beyond the maximum limit of 100 values (the web version allows a limit of 500 values)? Is pagination possible, and if so, how do we use it?
* Should we check other results whose matches are only partial?
* Do we need non-functional tests, such as load or performance tests?

In a real project, when we have access to source code, test infrastructure, and manipulation of test data, answering these questions is much easier, and as a result, it is easier to build higher-quality tests. Additionally, many tests can be implemented at lower levels (for example, component-level tests).

In the second test, we are indeed using the results of the first test, which, in my opinion, is not a good practice. It's better to make tests atomic and independent. Additionally, we can check not only if the page date is greater than expected but also if it is less than the current date, and we can also validate other fields.

Furthermore, this test uses the API Pages section, which contains more endpoints that allow not only fetching data but also creating and modifying it. The approach to testing them may differ, because it requires authorization and also changes resources and reproducibility of that tests could be problem
